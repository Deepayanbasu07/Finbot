    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

4.  **Install dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content (or add any other specific versions you used):
    ```txt
    Flask
    Flask-CORS
    Werkzeug
    PyMuPDF
    nltk
    vaderSentiment
    afinn
    faiss-cpu # or faiss-gpu if you have a compatible GPU and setup
    langchain
    langchain-ollama
